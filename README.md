## How It Works

### For Kids
- Log in to see checking and savings balances
- **NEW:** Create multiple checking accounts with custom nicknames (if enabled by parent)
- Request withdrawals (parents hand over the cash in real life)
- Transfer between checking and savings
- See full transaction history

### For Parents
- See all kids' accounts at a glance
- **NEW:** Create multiple checking accounts for kids with custom nicknames (e.g., "Spend", "Donate", "Save")
- **NEW:** Split allowances across multiple checking accounts with custom percentages
- Deposit money into any kid's account
- Approve or reject withdrawal requests
- Configure per-kid allowance (amount, frequency, target account)
- Configure interest rates on savings accounts
- Manage family members and settings

### Multiple Checking Accounts (NEW! ✨)

Kids can now organize their money into different categories! Create up to 5 checking accounts with nicknames like:
- 💰 **Spend** — Money for fun purchases
- 💝 **Donate** — Money for charity
- 🎯 **Save** — Saving for a specific goal
- 🚨 **Emergency** — Emergency fund
- 🎮 **Gaming** — Money for games

Parents can automatically split allowances across these accounts. For example:
- 60% to Spend
- 30% to Save
- 10% to Donate

A background scheduler runs hourly to:
- Process due allowance payments
- Apply interest to savings accounts
